# pyLogos
experimental Python based HDL

pyLogos is a free, open-source package for using Python as a hardware description and verification language.


pyLogos is inspired by and derived from [MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/). It is more (loosely) modeled after VHDL

It tries to be a pure and minimal implementation and avoids Python types in the HDL section.
